### SX1276 / Sigfox on Murata module example code

This example code is demonstrating how to implement a sigfox communication on a Murata CMWX1ZZABZ module (stm32 + sx1276). This example is based on [Disk91 STM32 IoT SDK repository](https://github.com/disk91/stm32-it-sdk) where the driver code is.

The hardware configuration has been set with CubeMX.
